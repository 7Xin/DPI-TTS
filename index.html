        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            Speech diffusion models have seen rapid advancements in recent years. While the widely-used U-net architecture remains prominent, transformer-based models, such as DiT (Diffusion Transformer), have also garnered significant attention. However, existing DiT-based speech models often treat Mel spectrograms merely as generic images, thereby overlooking the specific acoustic properties inherent to speech. 
To address these limitations, we propose a novel method called DPI-TTS, which leverages a direct patch interaction approach based on DiT. This method is designed to train quickly without sacrificing accuracy. Notably, the low-to-high frequency, frame-by-frame progressive inference approach employed by DPI-TTS aligns more closely with acoustic properties, thus enhancing the naturalness of the synthesized speech. Additionally, we introduce a fine-grained style temporal modeling method, which further improves the speaker style similarity of DPI-TTS. Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only accelerates training speed but also outperforms baselines.
