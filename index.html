        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            Nowadays, speech diffusion models are developing rapidly. In addition to the commonly used U-net, DiT models based on transformers have also emerged.
            However, current DiT speech models treat Mel spectrograms as general images, overlooking the acoustic properties of speech in both the time and frequency domains.
            Therefore, we propose DPI-TTS: Directional Patch Interaction for Fast-Converging and Style Temporal Modeling in Text-to-Speech. 
            DPI-TTS improves training speed by associating each patch of the Mel spectrogram with its surrounding components rather than the entire Mel spectrogram.
            Additionally, DPI-TTS infers high frequencies from low frequencies and each frame from the previous one, according to acoustic properties. 
            This approach improves the temporal consistency of speech and results in a slight enhancement in naturalness compared to the baseline.
            Finally, DPI-TTS improves the stability of style representation in the rapid speech modeling process through style-temporal modeling. Experimental results show that the style similarity of our method is close to the baseline.
